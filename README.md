# 📊 Database Projects Portfolio
📍 NIAT Hyderabad | 🎓 1st Year Student
Hi! I'm a first‑year student at NIAT, and this repository showcases the five database projects I completed while learning Database Management Systems (DBMS).
Each project involves designing an Entity‑Relationship (ER) model, writing SQL schemas, and inserting data into well‑structured relational tables.

🎯 What This Repository Includes
This repo contains five mini‑projects, each based on real‑world use‑cases:

Project No.	Title	Brief Description
1️⃣	University Examination System	Manage departments, faculty, students, and exam schedules
2️⃣	Hotel Chain Management	Track hotel rooms, bookings, guests, staff, and feedback
3️⃣	Online Bookstore	Handle books, authors, customers, orders, wishlists, and genres
4️⃣	Logistics & Supply Chain	Monitor shipments, carriers, warehouses, origins, destinations, clients
5️⃣	Research Projects Database	Manage research projects, employees, managers, and funding agencies

Each folder contains:

An ER diagram (ER_Diagram.png)

SQL table‑creation script (create_tables.sql)

Sample data inserts (insert_data.sql)
